* Write a stylesheet that adds a “conversion” menu next to the servings menu.
* Allow the user to select either “Imperial” or “Metric” units.
* For metric, conversions:
  * A `tsp` is about 6ml
  * A `Tbs` is 15ml
  * A `cup` is 284ml
  * A `lb` is 0.454kg
  * An `oz` is 28.35g
  * A `qt` is 1.137ℓ
  * An `in` is 2.54cm
  * To convert °F to °C, subtract 32 and then multiply by 5/9.
* For imperial, you can just display the original values
