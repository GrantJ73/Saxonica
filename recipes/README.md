# Recipes

This is a small collection of recipes used for many of the exercises
in the tutorial. All of them are delicious.

The `categories.json` file is used by the server to support returning
a list of categories and a list of recipes in a particular category.

The `template.xml` file is a template to make adding recipes easier.
